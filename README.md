# Operating-assignment-part-2
# For this assignment we had to implement a bankers algorithm to answer a question

The question is if the system is in a safe state and what is the safe sequence?
To answer this we needed to format the table given to us into a txt file that can be read from lines.
Starting off this banker algorithm has been solved before but figuring out the code would have been something else

To start I have included the input.txt file as the formatted form of our table and the banker.cpp file as the code itself
the code has been compiled before so I have included the output file the a.out file as well since the output is always the same
the system is safe and needs to be put into a specific order to have a safe sequence
Using help from others I was able to have some code to have a basis to work off of from there however I had to format the data into something that is readable and figure out the safe sequence on my own so that I can actually figure out what code I need to use to get my answer
